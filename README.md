python and mongoDB
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One,
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use
this CRUD Python module in the future?

You write maintainable code by making it readable with comments and dividing the areas up into small chunks. The advantages of working this way are to allow the developer a map in which to follow to develop new code. The CRUD module could be used in a database retrieval app that gets documents from MongoDB.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create
 databases to meet other client requests?
 
 I approach a problem by breaking it down into parts and overcoming them one after another. It differed by including a module to import so we could have functionality in my dashboard. I would use the same method in the future.
 
 
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, 
to do their work better?

Computer Scientists research problems with apps and overcome them by writing code that is readable and easy to follow. It would help a company do their work better
by allowing them to use an app to research their data instead of using the commmand line.
